Hey everyone!

I've decided that I should take up blogging to document the things
I learn as a programmer. So this is another developer's blog. I'm hoping 
by maintaining this blog, it would help maintain my motivation to learn, 
and hopefully contribute to open source projects.

I've made a GitHub pages site before, but I didn't really do much with
it. It was mostly to learn about web development and [Jekyll]. So I would
say it served its purpose. Plus, I like working with Jekyll. It gives
you just enough to make web development eaiser without abstracting the
process too much. Maybe I'll change the theme in the future, but for now
using the default [Minima] theme is fine.

Lastly, I should probably update some of my social media. I should start off
by changing the default profile picture GitHub provides:

<img src="{{ site.images }}github-default.png" alt="GitHub Profile" height="200" width="200">

I've also changed my GitHub user name to [{{site.github_username}}], 
which resulted in me having to fix a lot of local git settings, (Mostly just 
updating the remote origin for my local projects). It also removed my old GitHub site, 
since the username doesn't match. That and looking at code from my past newbie
web developer self has lead me to wanting to create a new site. Maybe I should 
actually start using my Twitter account. Currently my profile picture is a banana dog..

<a href="https://twitter.com/jerryq27">
    <img src="{{ site.images }}banana-dog.jpg" alt="Banana Dog" height="200" width="200">
</a>

classic. 

On second thought, I might keep it that way.

Anyway, that's enough content for the first blog post. I have quite a few projects I would
like to finish which includes an Android app, a game, a web app, and this blog. Hopefully
documenting the process of each of these projects will motivate me to complete them!

Wish me luck! :)
