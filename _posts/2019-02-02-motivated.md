So, I recently got a spark of motivation. I've been watching developers
stream their dev sessions on twitch while I work. (I don't know why, it
helps me concentrate). I came across a streamer who was just putting on
a good vibe in his stream. Guy was an absolute legend. The passion he
showed while figuring out his current issue was awesome. I got motivated
to just code after that.

Right when I got home, I fired up Android Studio and got to work on a
personal project of mine. The thing is, I've always had trouble 'clicking'
with Android dev. I always felt like their were so many classes, and 
different ways to do things. I was trying to figure out audio playback, 
and that was more complicated than I thought it would be. So, I put my
project down for a while.

Well, this time was different, I decided to make Android my bitch today.
Wow, I did not expect to be coding for 5 hours straight. I surprise myself.
The amount of Trello cards I was able to drag to 'Finished' was satisfying.
The Android docs didn't confuse me as much as it used to.

Maybe it's from the experience I've been getting at my job, or the motivation
from that Twictch streamer I got today. I don't know, but I'm glad I'm back
to making progress on this project. I'm also starting to feel like I'm 'clicking' with Android now :)
