To start off, I really like the [Carte Noire] theme. I have a weakness for dark themes,
especially those with the cyan accent color. However, simply cloning a theme and
changing pictures, links, and names to my own isn't really enough. At that point,
I just grabbed another dev's site and put my face on it. I really want to give some
of my own flavor to this theme and get my hands dirty with some code to really
make this site my own!

First thing I decided to change was the dark theme's color pallete.

I thought the grays were a little too bright for my liking. A few minutes with the
Material Design docs and some code refactoring later:

Now that's a sexy looking dark theme!

Next up, I was enjoying the new look of the site, but highlighting text was giving
me that default blue we're all used to. I didn't like the look, it was really killing
the vibe I had going with my site, especially with highlighting code snippets

As a newbie web dev, I thought to myself, "Can you actually change that...? Oh WOW, yes! Yes, [you can]!"

That feels much better. I think the look and feel of the site are matching up.
There are a few things I would like to change, the side bar's background color is
doing its own thing. Also, the syntax highlighting of code snippets could use an
upgrade as well.

Maybe for another post, I the past few hours today learning how the original author
of the theme organized his code. I think now have a good idea where things are at
and I'm feeling more confident changing things here and there without breaking the
site.

I'll be sure to add some more changes in the future!
