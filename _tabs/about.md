My name is Gerardo Quintero and I am a graduate from the University of Nebraska at Kearney
with a bachelor's in Computer Science. I'm currently self-employed as a Full Stack developer
for my company, JerryQ LLC. It's safe to say that I do enjoy working with software and
my future career goals are within that field. I also have an interest in teaching about programming
due to my experience as a tutor and teacher's assistant at UNK.

A third interest I have in my future career goals is to be in a position that allows me to pursue a nomadic lifestyle.
I have studied abroad in South Korea and Japan. I've also had the opportunity to visit Taiwan and Australia.
I've really enjoyed my time in each country and with learning the languages.
So I believe the perfect career for me would be a remote position in the software field.
